In this tutorial, I'll show you how to Build a Social Media DApp just like YouTube & how to Deploy it on Polygon (Matic) Mumbai Test Network.<br>
I'll start the tutorial from scratch (MetaMask installation process to hosting the DApp on IPFS using Fleek).<br>
So, grab a cup of coffee ☕️ and let's get started!

## Basics & Installation Setup
We need the following things on your computer to build our DApp.
### Node | npm: 

### Truffle:
Truffle is the best development environment for developing blockchain applications. Truffle gives us boilerplate code (template code) to start building our DApp.
To install truffle open your `windows cmd prompt` or `mac terminal` and paste the following command.
`npm install -g truffle`
